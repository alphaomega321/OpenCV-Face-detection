# OpenCV-Face-detection
Currently working on a project that can take attendance using face detection, so far I have implemented: 1) make-dataset: Uses default camera to take thousands of pictures of a subject based on the university's registration number. 2) face-train: Using Haar-Cascade classifier we train the model. 3) Using LBPH Face recogsizer we recognise the faces

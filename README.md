# OpenCV-Face-detection
The project can take attendance using face detection
I have implemented:
1) make-dataset: Uses default camera to take thousands of pictures of a subject based on the university's registration number.
2) face-train: Using Haar-Cascade classifier we train the model. 
3) Using LBPH Face recogsizer we recognise the faces
4) Android application that uses Flask to communicate with Rpi
